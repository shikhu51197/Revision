📌 Combined Challenge – “Student Dashboard App”

👉 Build a Student Dashboard where all concepts from Day 1–7 are applied naturally:
Routing (Navbar + Pages)
State & Event Handling (Attendance toggle)
Destructuring Props (StudentCard)
map & Conditional Rendering (Subjects list)
Form Handling (Profile form)
Reusable Props + Tailwind Styling (Button component)


Requirements

1. Header & Routing
Create a navigation bar with links: Dashboard, Profile, and Contact.
Use React Router for navigation.



2. State & Event Handling
On the Dashboard page, show a button "Show Attendance" that toggles between "Present" ✅ and "Absent" ❌.



3. Destructuring Props
Pass a student object ({name, age, grade}) to a StudentCard component and display the details using destructuring.



4. map & Conditional Rendering
Display a list of subjects ([{id, subject, completed}]).
If completed === true, show "Completed ✅" else "Pending ❌".



5. Form Handling
On the Profile page, create a form to update username and password.
On submit, display the entered data below the form, then clear input fields.



6. Props & Tailwind Styling
Create a reusable Button component with a theme prop ("primary", "secondary", "danger").
Use Tailwind to style it differently based on the theme (e.g., blue for primary, gray for secondary, red for danger).
Use this button for form submit, toggle attendance, etc.
